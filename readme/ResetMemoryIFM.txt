We are quite often confronted with this "not enough memory" message. And most times it is still enough memory  on the device.

We know this problem and will offer a service release in the next few weeks. 


Meanwhile you can erase the PLC memory by executing a Linux command.

To do so please open a telnet session. You can do that with  telnet  or with the software called "putty".

telnet 192.168.10.1 

where 192.168.10.1 is the IP-address of my AC14.

Login: root
Password: ecoxx41ca

Type in this command:

rm  -rf  /media/user0/C*

(!! user0 <- that's a "zero")

This command deletes all CODESYS related files and also resets the PLC memory.  

After this command is finished you can type in:

reboot

and the AC14 is doing a system reboot.

After this system reboot you can again download the software without getting this "out of memory message".
